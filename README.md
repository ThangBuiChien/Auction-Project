# Auction-Project
How to Run the Project Locally:

Step 1: Create a database in PostgreSQL. (Simply create the database; JPA will automatically generate the table and constraints.) Note: We use PostgreSQL, and it's unclear whether other RDBMSs work well with this setup.

Step 2: Connect to your database by editing or creating a new persistence.xml file.

Step 3: Run the project and enjoy! =))
